## HTML templates and Javascript

Javascript was not requested for this task. However seeing that the 3 option panels followed a very obvious template, I figured I should keep the code DRY and create an html template. To the best of my knowledge, html templates can only be implemented with javascript. This should not take away from any assessment of html and css, since the template itself also requires structure and styling. I am aware that introducing javascript introduces its own small risks, since there may be times whern javascript may be unavailable to the user, intentionally or otherwise.

## Responsiveness

This single page site has been designed with responsiveness in mind, using flexbox and media queries. Please try it out.

## Total Time
**8 hours**  
Time included research and implementation of ...
* HTML templates
* Responsiveness using pure flexbox instead of media queries (unsuccessful)
* Changing icon colours
* creating transparent backgrounds
* converting eye dropper result to hex code.
